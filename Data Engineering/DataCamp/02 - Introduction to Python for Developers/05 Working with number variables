# Working with number variables

# Store the number of garlic cloves (3) as an integer variable called garlic_cloves.
# Store the amount of olive oil in tablespoons (2.5) as a float variable called olive_oil_tbsp.
# Increase the amount of olive oil by 1 tablespoon and store it to new_olive_oil_tbsp.

# Store the number of garlic cloves as an integer
garlic_cloves = 3

# Store the olive oil amount as a float
olive_oil_tbsp = 2.5
print(olive_oil_tbsp)

# Increase the olive oil amount
new_olive_oil_tbsp = 2.5 +1

print(garlic_cloves)
print(new_olive_oil_tbsp)
