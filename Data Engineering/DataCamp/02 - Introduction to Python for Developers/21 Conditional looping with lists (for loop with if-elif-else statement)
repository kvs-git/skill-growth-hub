# Conditional looping with lists (for loop with if-elif-else statement)

# Loop through each quantity in the quantities list using qty as your iterator variable.
# Inside the loop, add a conditional that checks if the qty is greater than or equal to 400 grams. If so, print 'Large quantity'.
# Add an elif condition to check if the qty is greater than or equal to 200 grams. If so, print 'Medium quantity'.
# Add an else clause to handle all remaining quantities and print 'Small quantity'.

for qty in quantities:
    # Check if it's a large quantity (400g or more)
