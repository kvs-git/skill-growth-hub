# Looping through a list (for loop)

# Create a for loop that iterates through the ingredients list, using item as the iterator variable.
# Now create a for loop that iterates from 1 to 6 to keep track of how many ingredients you've added.

ingredients = ["fusilli", "tomatoes", "garlic", "basil", "olive oil", "salt"]

# Loop through each ingredient in the list
for item in ingredients :
    print(item)
	
# Iterate over the number of ingredients
for item in range(1,7) :
    print("Adding ingredient", item)
