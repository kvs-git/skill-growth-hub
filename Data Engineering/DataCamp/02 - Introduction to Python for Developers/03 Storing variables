# Storing variables

# You're building your first Python project - a recipe scaler! 
# Before you can scale recipes, you need to learn how to store ingredient information. 
# In Python, you use variables to store values you'll use multiple times. 
# For recipes, you'll need to store ingredient names (text, called strings) and quantities (whole numbers, called integers). 
# Let's start by storing information for a pasta recipe.

# Store the pasta type as a string
pasta_type = "spaghetti"

# Store the quantity as an integer
quantity = 80

# Print the pasta type
print(pasta_type)

# Print the quantity
print(quantity)
