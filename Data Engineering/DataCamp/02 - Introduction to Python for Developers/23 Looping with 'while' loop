# Looping with 'while' loop

# Write a while loop that continues as long as guest_count is less than total_confirmations.
# Inside the while loop, increment guest_count by 1 each time to count another confirmation.

total_confirmations = 10
guest_count = 0

# Count confirmations using a while loop
while guest_count<total_confirmations:
    guest_count+=1
    print(guest_count, "guests so far!")

print("We have", guest_count, "guests coming!")
