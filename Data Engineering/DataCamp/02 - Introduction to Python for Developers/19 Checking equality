# Checking equality

# Use an equality check to compare basil_grams with required_basil in the if statement condition.
# Else, print a message when you don't have the exact amount needed.

# Check if you have exactly the right amount of basil
if basil_grams == required_basil:
    print('Perfect! You have exactly the right amount of basil.')
else:
    print('You need to adjust your basil quantity.')
