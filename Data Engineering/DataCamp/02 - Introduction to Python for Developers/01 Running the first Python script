# To build our first ever Python project as a developer, we need to verify that Python is installed and everything is working correctly.
# To do this, we may use the print() function to display a message. 

# Your first print function
print("Hello, world!")

Writing our first Python script
# Fill in the print function
print("Welcome to the recipe scaler")
