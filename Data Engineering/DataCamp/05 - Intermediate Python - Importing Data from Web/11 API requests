# Import requests package
import requests

#Note: Recently, OMDB has changed their API: you now also have to specify an API key. This means you'll have to add another argument to the URL: apikey=72bc447a.

# Assign to the variable url the URL of interest in order to query 'http://www.omdbapi.com' for the data corresponding to the movie The Social Network. 
# The query string should have two arguments: apikey=72bc447a and t=the+social+network. You can combine them as follows: apikey=72bc447a&t=the+social+network.

# Assign URL to variable: url
url = 'http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=72bc447a&t=the+social+network'

# Package the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Print the text of the response
print(r.text)
