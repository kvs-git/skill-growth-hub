# What are the tables in the database

# Background:
# You'll once again create an engine to connect to 'Chinook.sqlite'
# You'll save the table names to a list using the method .table_names() on the engine and then you will print the list.



# Excercises:
# Import the function create_engine from the module sqlalchemy.
# Create an engine to connect to the SQLite database 'Chinook.sqlite' and assign it to engine.
# Using the method .table_names() on the engine engine, assign the table names of 'Chinook.sqlite' to the variable table_names.
# Print the object table_names to the shell.


# Import necessary module
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')

# Save the table names to a list: table_names
table_names = engine.table_names()

# Print the table names to the shell
print(table_names)
