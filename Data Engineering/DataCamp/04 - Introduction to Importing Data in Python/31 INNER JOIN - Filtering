# INNER JOIN - Filtering

# Background:
# You'll perform an INNER JOIN and filter the result using a WHERE clause.
# The following code has already been executed to import the necessary packages and to create the engine:
	# import pandas as pd
	# from sqlalchemy import create_engine
	# engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')	

# Excercises:
# Use the pandas function read_sql_query() to assign to the variable df the DataFrame of results from the following query: 
	# select all records from PlaylistTrack INNER JOIN Track on PlaylistTrack.TrackId = Track.TrackId that satisfy the condition Milliseconds < 250000.



# Execute query and store records in DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM PlaylistTrack INNER JOIN Track on PlaylistTrack.TrackId = Track.TrackId WHERE Milliseconds < 250000", engine)

# Print head of DataFrame
print(df.head())
