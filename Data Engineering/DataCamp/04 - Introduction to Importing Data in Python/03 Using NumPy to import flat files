# Using NumPy to import flat files

# Background:
# In this exercise, you're now going to load the MNIST digit recognition dataset using the numpy function loadtxt() and see just how easy it can be: 
	# The first argument will be the filename.
	# The second will be the delimiter which, in this case, is a comma. 
# The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, frequently used in the field of machine learning. 
# It serves as a benchmark for evaluating algorithm performance in recognizing and classifying these numbers.

# Excercises:
# Fill in the arguments of np.loadtxt() by passing file and a comma ',' for the delimiter.
# Fill in the argument of print() to print the type of the object digits. Use the function type().
# Execute the rest of the code to visualize one of the rows of the data.


# Import packages
import numpy as np

# Assign filename to variable: file
file = 'digits.csv'

# Load file as array: digits
digits = np.loadtxt(file, delimiter=',')

# Print datatype of digits
print(type(digits))

# Select and reshape a row
im = digits[21, 1:]
im_sq = np.reshape(im, (28, 28))

# Plot reshaped data (matplotlib.pyplot already loaded as plt)
plt.imshow(im_sq, cmap='Greys', interpolation='nearest')
plt.show()
