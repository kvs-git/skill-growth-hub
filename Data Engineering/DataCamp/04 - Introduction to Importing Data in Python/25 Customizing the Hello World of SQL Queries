# Customizing the Hello World of SQL Queries

# Background:
# You're going to figure out how to customize your query in order to:
	# Select specified columns from a table;
	# Select a specified number of rows;
	# Import column names from the database table.
# Packages have already been imported as follows:
	# from sqlalchemy import create_engine
	# import pandas as pd
# The engine has also already been created:
	# engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')
# The engine connection is already open with the statement
	# with engine.connect() as con:
# All the code you need to complete is within this context.



# Excercises:
# Execute the SQL query that selects the columns LastName and Title from the Employee table. Store the results in the variable rs.
# Apply the method fetchmany() to rs in order to retrieve 3 of the records. Store them in the DataFrame df.
# Using the rs object, set the DataFrame's column names to the corresponding names of the table columns.



# Open engine in context manager
# Perform query and save results to DataFrame: df
with engine.connect() as con:
    rs = con.execute("select LastName, Title FROM Employee")
    df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchmany(size = 3))
    df.columns = rs.keys()

# Print the length of the DataFrame df
print(len(df))

# Print the head of the DataFrame df
print(df.head())
