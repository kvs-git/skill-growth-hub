# Not so flat any more

# Background:
# You can explore your current working directory natively in Python using the library os, which consists of miscellaneous operating system interfaces. 
# The first line of the following code imports the library os, the second line stores the name of the current directory in a string called wd and the third outputs the contents of the directory in a list to the shell.


import os
wd = os.getcwd()
os.listdir(wd)


# Excercises:
# Run this code in the shell and answer the following questions. Ignore the files that begin with ..
	# (1) which file is in your directory and NOT an example of a flat file; (
	# (2) why is it not a flat file?
	
# Possible Answer:
	# Option (A) Option A) database.db is not a flat file because relational databases contain structured relationships and flat files do not.
	# Option (B) battledeath.xlsx is not a flat because it is a spreadsheet consisting of many sheets, not a single table.
	# Option (C) titanic.txt is not a flat file because it is a .txt, not a .csv.

# Output: 
# ['titanic.txt', 'battledeath.xlsx']

# Answer: 
# Option (B) battledeath.xlsx is not a flat because it is a spreadsheet consisting of many sheets, not a single table.
