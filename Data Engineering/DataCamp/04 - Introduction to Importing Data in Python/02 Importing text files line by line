# Importing text files line by line

# Background:
# For large files, we may not want to print all of their content to the shell: you may wish to print only the first few lines. 
# Enter the .readline() method, which allows you to do this. 
# When a file called file is open, you can print out the first line by executing file.readline(). 
# If you execute the same command again, the second line will print, and so on.
# Let's use the concept of a context manager to bind a variable file by using a context manager construct: with open('filename') as file:
# While still within this construct, the variable file will be bound to open('filename'); thus, to print the file to the shell, all the code you need to execute is: 

# Excercises:
# Open moby_dick.txt using the with context manager and the variable file.
# Print the first three lines of the file to the shell by using .readline() three times within the context manager.


# Read & print the first 3 lines
with open('moby_dick.txt') as file:
    print(file.readline())
    print(file.readline())
    print(file.readline())
