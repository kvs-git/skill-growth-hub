# Importing HDF5 files

# Background:
# The file 'LIGO_data.hdf5' is already in your working directory. you'll import it using the h5py library. 
# The last exercise's file, 'disarea.dta', is still in your working directory.
# You'll also print out its datatype to confirm you have imported it correctly. 
# You'll then study the structure of the file in order to see precisely what HDF groups it contains.


# Excercises:
# Import the package h5py.
# Assign the name of the file to the variable file.
# Load the file as read only into the variable data.
# Print the datatype of data.
# Print the names of the groups in the HDF5 file 'LIGO_data.hdf5'.



# Import packages
import numpy as np
import h5py

# Assign filename: file
file = 'LIGO_data.hdf5'

# Load file: data
data = h5py.File(file, 'r')

# Print the datatype of the loaded file
print(type(data))

# Print the keys of the file
for key in data.keys():
    print(key)
