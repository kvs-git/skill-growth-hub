# Calculating file sizes using lambda functions

# Background:
# Lambda functions are handy for quickly creating short, one-line functions that can be used immediately without the need for formal def definitions.
# In this exercise, you'll work with a lambda function that calculates the total file size including extra space needed for file information. extra_space is calculated as a percent of file_size.



# Excercises:
# Define the calculate_total lambda that adds the extra_space to the base file size.
# Call calculate_total() on the file_size variable.



file_size = 2500
extra_space = 0.15

# Define a lambda function
calculate_total = lambda x: x * (1 + extra_space)

# Call the lambda function
print(calculate_total(file_size))
