# Avoiding errors

# Background:
# There are couple of approaches for error handling that can be applied to custom functions.
# In this exercise, you'll test out one of the approaches that avoids raising an error, printing a helpful message if an error occurs, but not terminating the script.


# Excercises
# Use a keyword allowing you to attempt to run code that cleans text.
# Use another keyword that prints a helpful message if an error occurs when calling the clean_text() function.


def clean_text(text):
  # Attempt to clean the text
  try:
    return text.replace(" ", "_").lower()
  # Run this code if an error occurs
  except:
    print("The clean_text() function expects a string as an argument, please check the data type provided!")
    
clean_text(187)
