# Adding arbitrary arguments

# Background:
# Python allows custom functions to accept any number of positional arguments through the use of "Arbitrary arguments". 
# This flexibility enables functions to be used in a variety of ways while still producing the expected results.
# Using this power, you'll build a function that concatenates (joins together) strings, regardless of how many blocks of text are provided!



# Excercises:
# Define a function called concat() that accepts arbitrary arguments called args.
# Use a for loop to iterate over each arg in args.
# Call the function to test that it works correctly.



# Define a function called concat
def concat(*args):
  """Concatenates multiple string arguments with spaces between them."""

  result = ""

  # Iterate over the Python args tuple
  for arg in args:
    result += " " + arg
  return result

# Call the function
print(concat("Python", "is", "great!"))
