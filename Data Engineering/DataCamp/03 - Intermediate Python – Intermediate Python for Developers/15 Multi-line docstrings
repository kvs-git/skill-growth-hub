# Multi-line docstrings

# Background:
# Sometimes single-line docstrings are sufficient, but if your function is more complex or has several arguments, then it is generally a better choice to include a multi-line docstring.
# You'll practice this by creating a multi-line docstring for the clean_text() function you made earlier.



# Excercises:
# Add the following summary to the docstring: Clean text by swapping spaces to underscores and converting to lowercase..



def clean_text(text, lower=True):
    # Add a multi-line docstring
    """
    Clean text by swapping spaces to underscores and converting to lowercase.
    
    """
    clean_text = text.replace(' ', '_')
    if lower == False:
        return clean_text
    else:
        return clean_text.lower()
