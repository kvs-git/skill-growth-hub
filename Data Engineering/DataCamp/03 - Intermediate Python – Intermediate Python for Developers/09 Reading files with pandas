# Reading files with pandas

# Background:
# In real-world projects, data lives in files, not dictionaries. 
# Whether you're building an e-commerce platform, implementing analytics dashboards, or debugging transaction issues, quickly loading and inspecting your data is the critical first step.
# pandas makes this effortless - you can load files and immediately check column types, memory usage, and missing values, helping you catch data quality issues early.
# A sales.csv file with user IDs, dates, and order values columns has been loaded for you.

# Excercises:
# Read in "sales.csv", saving as sales_df.
# Display the DataFrame info.


# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Read in sales.csv
sales_df = pd.read_csv("sales.csv")

# Display the DataFrame info
print("--- DataFrame Info ---")
print(sales_df.info())
