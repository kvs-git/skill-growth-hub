# Debugging code

# Background:
# Developers will inevitably produce errors when writing code; this is completely normal. 
# The ability to read error messages and debug or fix your code is a crucial skill when building or maintaining software.
# In this exercise, you have been provided with code that produces errors and will need to identify the cause so that you can resolve these issues.



# Excercises:
# Fix the code provided so that it creates and then prints the sales list without any errors.



# Define the sales list
sales = [125.97, 84.32, 99.78, 154.21, 78.50, 83.67, 111.13]

# Print the sales list
print(sales)
