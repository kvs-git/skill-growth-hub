# Finding the average

# Background:
# Your next task is to check delivery times during peak dinner hours (6-9 PM) for a restaurant to optimize platform performance. 
# You have a delivery_times list containing delivery times in minutes.
# Let's use the built-in functions to calculate the average delivery time.


# Excercises
# Find the average delivery time, saving as average_time.
# Round the average_time to two decimal places, saving as average_rounded.

delivery_times = [19, 25, 35, 40, 28, 32, 29, 31]

# Find the average delivery time
average_time = sum(delivery_times) / len(delivery_times)

# Round the average delivery time to two decimal places
average_rounded = round(average_time, 2)

print("Average delivery time:", average_rounded)
