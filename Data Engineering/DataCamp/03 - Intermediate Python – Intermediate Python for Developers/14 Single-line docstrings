# Single-line docstrings

# Background:
# Docstrings are used to explain the purpose of a function. 
# While the function name should be descriptive, this needs to be balanced with the length of the function name, so docstrings allow you to provide more detail.
# In this exercise, you'll take the previously created calculate_discount() function and add a single-line docstring.


# Excercises:
# Add a docstring stating """Calculate the discounted price of a product.""".
# Access the function's docstring using the appropriate attribute.


def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent=15, round_result=True):
    # Add a single-line docstring
    """Calculate the discounted price of a product."""
    
    discounted_price = price - (price * (discount_percent / 100))
    if round_result == True:
        return round(discounted_price, 2)
    else:
        return discounted_price

# Access the docstring
print(calculate_discount.__doc__)
