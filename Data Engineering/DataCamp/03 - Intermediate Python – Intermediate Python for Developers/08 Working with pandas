# Working with pandas

# Background:
# pandas is one of Python's most popular packages for data analysis and manipulation. 
# It provides powerful data structures like DataFrames, which let you work with structured data efficiently - filtering, aggregating, and transforming datasets with just a few lines of code. 
# As a developer, you'll often encounter pandas when building e-commerce platforms, processing transaction data, or implementing analytics features for business dashboards.
# In this exercise, the sales dictionary has been created and contains information on recent transactions.

# Excercises
# Import the pandas module using an alias of pd.
# Convert sales into a DataFrame, saving as sales_df.
# Preview the first few rows of sales_df.


# Import pandas as pd
import pandas as pd

# Convert sales to a pandas DataFrame
sales_df = pd.DataFrame(sales)

# Preview the first few rows
print(sales_df.head())
