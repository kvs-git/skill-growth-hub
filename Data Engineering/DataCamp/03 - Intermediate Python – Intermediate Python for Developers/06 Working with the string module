# Working with the string module

# Background:
# Recently, you've seen several popular modules, including string, which is used to gather specific values, such as all uppercase characters, or format some text.
# This can be helpful if you need to check whether text contains specific characters or modify text, such as converting to lowercase.
# In this exercise, you'll import the module and access its ascii_lowercase and punctuation attributes.


# Excercises
# Import the string module.
# Access the module's .ascii_lowercase attribute.
# Access the module's .punctuation attribute.


# Import the string module
import string

# Print all ASCII lowercase characters
print(string.ascii_lowercase)

# Print all punctuation
print(string.punctuation)
