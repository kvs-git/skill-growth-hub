# Calculating key metrics (Min-Max-Sum)

# Background:
# As a developer for a food delivery platform, you might need to calculate important metrics for your business. 
# You have access to recent_orders, a list containing order amounts from the past hour during peak traffic.
# While you can manually calculate metrics, Python's built-in functions provide efficient and faster solutions.

# Excercises
# Find the smallest order amount, saving as smallest_order.
# Find the largest order amount, saving as largest_order.
# Calculate the total revenue, saving as total_revenue.

recent_orders = [15.99, 28.50, 42.75, 18.99, 55.00, 31.25, 22.99, 67.50]

# Find the smallest order amount
smallest_order = min(recent_orders)

# Find the largest order amount
largest_order = max(recent_orders)

# Calculate total revenue from all orders
total_revenue = sum(recent_orders)

print("Smallest order:", smallest_order)
print("Largest order:", largest_order)
print("Total revenue:", total_revenue)
