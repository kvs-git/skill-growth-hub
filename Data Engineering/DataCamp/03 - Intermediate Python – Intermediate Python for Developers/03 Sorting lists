# Sorting lists

# Background:
# Your food delivery platform is expanding as new restaurants join daily. You have a restaurants list with restaurant names and a cooking_times list showing average meal preparation times in minutes. 
# Your team needs both lists sorted to identify top-performing restaurants and improve delivery logistics..


# Excercises
# Sort restaurants alphabetically, saving as restaurants_sorted.
# Sort cooking_times from fastest to slowest, saving as cooking_times_sorted.


restaurants = ["Sushi Central", "Burger Hub", "Taco Town", "Pizza Palace"]
cooking_times = [30, 25, 35, 40, 28, 32, 29, 31, 12, 55]

# Sort restaurant names alphabetically
restaurants_sorted = sorted(restaurants)

# Sort cooking times from fastest to slowest
cooking_times_sorted = sorted(cooking_times)

print("Restaurants (A–Z):", restaurants_sorted)
print("Cooking times (ascending):", cooking_times_sorted)
