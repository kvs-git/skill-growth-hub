# Custom function syntax

# Background:
# As part of the IT support team, you frequently need to convert employee names into their company email addresses. 
# The company follows a standard email format: first name (lowercase) + dot + last name (lowercase) + @techcompany.com. For example, "Jane Doe" becomes jane.doe@techcompany.com.

# Excercises:
# Define a function called generate_email that takes one argument called full_name.
# Return the generated email from the function.
# Call the function on the full_name string.


full_name = "Alan Turing"

# Define the generate_email function
def generate_email(full_name):
    name_parts = full_name.split()
    email = name_parts[0].lower() + '.' + name_parts[1].lower() + '@techcompany.com'
    
    # Return the email address
    return email

# Call the function on the full_name string
print(generate_email(full_name))
