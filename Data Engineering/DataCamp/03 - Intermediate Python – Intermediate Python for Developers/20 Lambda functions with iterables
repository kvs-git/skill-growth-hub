# Lambda functions with iterables

# Background:
# You've used lambda functions on single values - now let's apply them to entire lists! This is where lambda functions really shine: when you need the same operation on every item.
# In this task, you'll process a list of colleague names using a lambda function applied to the entire list.



# Excercises:
# Apply the lambda function to each value in the colleagues list, saving as cleaned.
# Convert the map object to a list, saving as cleaned_list.



colleagues = ["Sarah Martinez", "Michael Chen", "Emily Brown"]

# Apply the lambda function to each colleague's name
cleaned = map(lambda x: x.replace(" ", "_").lower(), colleagues)

# Convert map object to list
cleaned_list = list(cleaned)
print(cleaned_list)
