# Building a password validator

# Background:
# Your team is developing an authentication system for a website. To ensure user accounts are secure, you need to create a validate_password() function that checks if passwords meet minimum security requirements. 
# The function should verify that a password is at least eight characters long and contains at least one special character from the string module's punctuation collection.
# The string module and a test password variable user_password are already imported for you.


# Excercises:
# Complete the validate_password() function to check if the password is at least 8 characters long.
# Add a loop to check if any character in the password exists in string.punctuation.
# Call the function with user_password, and store the result in is_valid.


test_durations = [245.50, 189.99, 312.75, 156.20, 428.90, 201.35, 167.80]

def validate_password(password):
    # Check if password is at least 8 characters long
    if len(password) >= 8:
        # Check if password contains a special character
        for char in password:
            if char in string.punctuation:
                return True
    return False

# Call the function and store the result
is_valid = validate_password(user_password)
print("Is the password valid? ", is_valid)
