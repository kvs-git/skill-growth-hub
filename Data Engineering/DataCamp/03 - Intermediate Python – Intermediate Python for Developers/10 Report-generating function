# Report-generating function

# Background:
# You learned that functions can return values, but they can also print results.
# Your development team needs regular reports on test execution times. 
# Instead of manually calculating these metrics each time, you'll create a custom function called test_report that prints a formatted summary without returning any values.
# A test_durations list with test execution times in seconds is provided for you.


# Excercises:
# Complete the function definition by adding durations as the argument.
# Calculate the total test time by using a built-in function on the durations.
# Generate the report for recent tests by calling the function on the test_durations list.


test_durations = [245.50, 189.99, 312.75, 156.20, 428.90, 201.35, 167.80]

 # Complete the function
def test_report(durations):
    num_tests = len(durations)
    
    # Calculate total test time
    total_time = sum(durations)
    
    print("=== Test Report ===")
    print("Total Tests: ", num_tests)
    print("Total Execution Time (s): ", total_time)

# Generate the report for recent test runs
print(test_report(test_durations))
