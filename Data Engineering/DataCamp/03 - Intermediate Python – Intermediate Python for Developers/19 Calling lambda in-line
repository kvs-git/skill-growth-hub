# Calling lambda in-line

# Background:
# Remember, one of the key benefits of lambda is the ability to use functions in-line.
# In this exercise, you'll modify the approach of the previous exercise to calculate the total file size in-line without storing a lambda function as a variable first.



# Excercises:
# In a single line of code, make a lambda function that multiplies file_size by 1 + extra_space and returns the results.



file_size = 2500
extra_space = 0.15

# Call a lambda function in one line
print((lambda x: x * (1 + extra_space))(file_size))
